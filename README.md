# Ace-It-Or-Face-It
Ace It or Face It is a single-player, probability-based card guessing game built with a standard deck and two Jokers. Players balance safe, high-probability choices against risky, high-reward guesses while managing limited lives across difficulty modes. The project demonstrates clean object-oriented design and extensible architecture.
